## Series solutions to differential equations using Mathematica  
We all know how painful finding a series solution to a differential equations is. [This mathematica notebook here] will help with that. It takes a differential equation
as input and print out the solution to that differential equation. The notebook has solution to `y''[x]+2y[x]==0` by default, but you may download the notebook and input 
some other function as input to see what results you get. You must input the function as you would in Mathematica however, and for that I recommend searching the web for 
Mathematica notations.
