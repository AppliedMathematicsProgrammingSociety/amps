## HANGMAN
The [rules](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman) of *Hangman* is as follows:
* The game is played between two players or more
* One player chooses a phrase, which could be a random word or the name of anything.
* The player choosing the phrase draws the stage for hanging and puts dashes where the letters of the phrase should go.
* The rest of the players then need to guess the letters of the phrase one by one.
* When the players guess a letter correctly, the other player has to put the letter in the blank places where it belongs.
* At this point, the other players can guess the entire phrase based on the position of the letters they correctly guessed.
* If the players guess a letter that doesn't belong to the phrase, it will count as a strike. In that case, first, the rope of the hangman will be drawn. The next strike will result in the drawing of the head, and so on.
* After a total of six wrong guesses, the entire hangman will be drawn.
* The game ends by correctly guessing the phrase or by the completion of the drawing of the hangman.

In this code, the code itself gives the phrase but not on its own. A library of phrases can be listed in a CSV file and given as input. Every time the code is executed, a random phrase is selected from the list. The CSV file of the names of the faculty members of the Department of Applied Mathematics is attatched here.
