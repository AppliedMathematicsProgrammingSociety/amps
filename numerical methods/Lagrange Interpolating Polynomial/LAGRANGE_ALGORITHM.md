## Theory  
First things first, we gotta get the theory of Lagrange interpolating polynomial first. Suppose we have two points in regular plane, and we wish to find the polynomial  
visits them both. There could be a lot of such polynomials, but the simplest on is a straight line. Say we wish to find the straight line between $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$.  
We assume the form  
$y = a_0+a_{1}x$
