## Using Newton's Forward Difference Method to approximate the value of an unknown point inside a data set

This program takes in a table as input where the entries under the x column goes as the x values and the y column takes in the y values.

When it is run, inside the terminal it will ask for the value of the unknown point at which the polynomial will be evaluated and it will output the approximation of the polynomial thus created using Newton's Forward Difference Method.

After its run, the difference table for this program will be generated in a CSV file named table.csv and it will show the difference table used for calculating the said polynomial.

Also, there is the fortran code for it where the difference table is outputted in the terminal itself:
