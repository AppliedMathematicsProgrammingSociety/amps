## Continued fraction  
Suppose we want to find the continued fraction of $\frac{62}{23}$  
Thus in the code we input 62 and 23 as our numerator and denominator respectively, which shows us an output  
```  
[2, 1, 2, 3, 2]  
```  
Which is the continued fraction of $\frac{62}{23}$  
ie $\LARGE\frac{62}{23} = 2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{3+\frac{1}{2}}}}$
