Problem:
schedule a tournament with n teams such that each team plays every other team exactly once


Input:
number of teams n


Output:
fixture of matches


Steps:
1. open text file containing the team names
2. ask user for number of teams n
3. read n team names from text file
4. if n odd, add a dummy team to the list to make n even
5. for the first n-2 rounds : 
   1. output - round k
   2. initialize a vector x of length n with entries 1
   3. if team i (i = 1 to n) is not assigned a match
      1. if 2i = k (mod n-1)
      2. if team n is dummy, bye round for team i
      3. else team i plays team n
x(i) = 0, x(n) = 0
   4. else team i plays team j, where i+j = k (mod n-1)
x(i) = 0, x(j) = 0
      6. for the last round : 
      1. output - round k
      2. initialize a vector x of length n with entries 1
      3. if team i (i = 1 to n-2) is not assigned a match
      1. output - team i plays team n-i-1
x(i) = 0, x(n-i-1) = 0
         4. if n odd - bye round for team n-1
         5. else - team n-1 plays team n-2
