Problem:
Find all prime numbers less than a given number 


Input:
Integer n


Output:
All prime numbers < n, number of prime numbers < n


Steps:
1. Ask for n, echo
2. If n positive
   1. Initialize an a boolean list of length n consisting of ones
   2. For all integers i less than ⌊√n⌋
      1. If list(i) is one
* All ones in the list that have an integer multiple index of i (less than n) are switched to zero
   1. Print all the index values that have a 1 in their position = prime numbers
   2. Count all such indices = Number of prime numbers
3. If n not positive, go to step 1
