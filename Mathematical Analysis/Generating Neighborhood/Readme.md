# Generating a neighborhood around x0 for a given  Î´

### Code Description
***

The code is a simple program that generates a neighborhood around a given value 'x0' with a specified range 'delta'. It consists of two functions: 'Neighborhood' and 'main'.

### Algorithm
***
1. Start the program.
2. Declare the 'Neighborhood' function that takes in two parameters: 'x0' (the central value) and 'delta' (the range).
3. Calculate the lower bound of the neighborhood by subtracting 'delta' from 'x0' and store the result in the variable 'lowerBound'.
4. Calculate the upper bound of the neighborhood by adding 'delta' to 'x0' and store the result in the variable 'upperBound'.
5. Output the neighborhood in the form of "Neighborhood is : [lowerBound, upperBound]" using the 'cout' statement.
6. Declare the 'main' function.
7. Declare two variables 'x0' and 'delta' to store the input values.
8. Prompt the user to enter the value of 'x0' using the 'cout' statement.
9. Read the input value of 'x0' from the user using the 'cin' statement.
10. Prompt the user to enter the value of 'delta' using the 'cout' statement.
11. Read the input value of 'delta' from the user using the 'cin' statement.
12. Call the 'Neighborhood' function, passing the values of 'x0' and 'delta'.
13. End the program.
