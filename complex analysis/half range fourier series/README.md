# Half Range Fourier Series
In the case of half range *Fourier* series, we turn a given function into an [*even function*](https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/even-function/) or an [*odd function*](https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/odd-functions/) and then turn it into a *fourier* series. In the case of [*half range cosie series*](https://www.intmath.com/fourier-series/4-fourier-half-range-functions.php), we use even functions. In the case of [*half range sine series*](https://www.intmath.com/fourier-series/4-fourier-half-range-functions.php), we turn the function into an odd function. In both cases in the program, the lower limit is 0. The program asks for the upper limit, the number of terms to be computed, and the function.
