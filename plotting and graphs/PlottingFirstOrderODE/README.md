# How to Sketch the direction fields of DE of the form y'= f(x,y) on the xy plane
This code generates a direction field plot for a given function of two variables, f(x,y), which represents the derivative of a function y(x) with respect to x. The direction field indicates the slope or direction of the function at each point in the (x,y) plane.


## Procedure 

The major steps are here . . . 




1. We import the necessary libraries math, numpy and matplotlib, which we will use to create and visualize the direction field.

2. Then we define the function f(x,y) that represents the right-hand side of the differential equation dy/dx = f(x,y). This function takes in two arguments, x and y, and returns a value that corresponds to the value of f(x,y) at that point.

3. We define the grid by specifying the range of x and y values, as well as the number of grid points in each direction. We use the np.linspace() function to create evenly spaced arrays of x and y values, and then use np.meshgrid() to create a grid of all possible combinations of x and y values.

4. Evaluate the function f(x,y) at each point in the grid to obtain the slope of the direction field at that point. The resulting values are stored in the arrays dx and dy.

5. Finally, we Plot the direction field using the quiver function from matplotlib.pyplot. The quiver function takes as input the x and y coordinates of each point in the grid, and the corresponding values of dx and dy, and draws arrows to represent the direction and magnitude of the slope at each point.


The resulting plot displays the direction field of the differential equation dy/dx = f(x,y) in the xy grid. Each arrow represents the direction and magnitude of the slope of the solution curve passing through that point in the grid.




## *Note*

The specific form of the function f(x,y) and the size and density of the grid can be adjusted by the user to visualize different types of differential equations and explore the behavior of their solutions.

for y'=f(x,y)=x+sin(y) the direction field will look like this

say, y'=(x**2-y**2)/(1+x**2+y**2); then, direction field of the solution curves is
