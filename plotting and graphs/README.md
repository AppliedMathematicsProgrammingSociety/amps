## Plotting 2D graphs  
Input any function in python standard, (ie write ** instead of ^ for exponentiation, use brackets for function calls) and some interval to generate a plot of the function  
As an example, let's plot $x^{2}$ over the interval [-2,2]

## Plotting 3D graphs as parametric curves of one variable  
We could also generate parametric curves if they are parametrizable using a single variable, and in that case we need to input 3 different functions of t for the x,y  
and z respectively  
For example we could plot $x=sin(t), y=cos(t) and z=e^{t}$ over [0,10]
