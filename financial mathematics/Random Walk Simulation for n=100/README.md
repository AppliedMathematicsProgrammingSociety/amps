## Brownian Motion Approximated by Random Walk n=100

In mathematics, a random walk is a random process that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space. Consequently in the world of finance, the theory of random walk suggests that the stock price today has no relation or influence on the stock price tomorrow, and the direction the stock price goes is entirely random and unpredictable.
